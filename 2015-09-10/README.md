Sky-subtracted incoherent noise spectra (SSINS)
of fifteen consecutive obs 1125948616-1125950320 per-antenna autocorrelation.
Capped at 3k for better color bar fit to data.

Antenna #s 115-127 are missing data for the last observation so they are only
14 obs long.

For the antenna names associated with the antenna numbers used here, see
