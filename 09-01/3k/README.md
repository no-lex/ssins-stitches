Sky-subtracted incoherent noise spectra (SSINS)
of fifteen consecutive obs 1093621000-1093622712 per-antenna autocorrelation.
Capped at 3k for better color bar fit to data.

Recievers 32-39 are not present as plots because the fifth reciever was not active
at the time of this observation.

Particular antennas of note:

### Wave patterns

61 (eighth reciever, sixth antenna)
75 (tenth reciever, fourth antenna)
78 (tenth reciever, seventh antenna)
79 (tenth reciever, eigth antenna)
92 (twelfth reciever, fifth antenna)
93 (twelfth reciever, sixth antenna)
95 (twelfth reciever, eigth antenna)
121 (sixteenth reciever, second antenna)

### Streaks in obs boundaries
These observations have some strange sky subtraction patterns at the boundaries
of observations in their cross (XY) polarization.

27 (fourth reciever, fourth antenna)
43 (sixth reciever, fourth antenna)
50 (seventh reciever, third antenna)
99 (eleventh reciever, fourth antenna)
106 (fourteenth reciever, third antenna)

### Other patterns of note

123 (sixteenth reciever, fourth antenna)
